# Ciclope
A visualization tool that aggregates various existing JS libraries and some CSS customization originally based on https://github.com/tamielbr/datatables-map. Our goal is to make it easy to use JSON source files to show diverse information (charts, timelines, tablets) as a way to communicate research output.

It uses:

* Datatables, http://datatables.net/
* TimelineJS, http://timeline.knightlab.com/
* LeafletJS, http://leafletjs.com/

Soon we aim to incorporate ChartJS, http://www.chartjs.org/ into the system.

The first project is focused on presenting data on the Open University of Brazil, http://uab.capes.gov.br. On the UAB folder you can find a example of Ciclope in use.
