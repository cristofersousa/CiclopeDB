# Ciclope
A map + tabs visualization tool that aggregates various existing JS libraries and some CSS customization originally based on https://github.com/tamielbr/datatables-map. Our goal is to make it easy to use JSON source files to show diverse information (charts, timelines, tablets) as a way to communicate research output.

The first project is focused on presenting data on the Open University of Brazil. On the UAB folder you can find a example of Ciclope in use.
